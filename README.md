Week 2 Milestone

So Here’s explanation in terms of:

1. Gathering Data – I have a dataset from Kaggle that includes pictures of both healthy and diseased plants.  

2. Training the Model – I use TensorFlow to help the AI learn patterns from these images so it can recognize plant diseases.  

3. Testing Accuracy – After training, I test the AI with new images to see how well it can identify diseases.  

4. Making Predictions – Once the AI is trained, I can give it a new plant image, and it will determine if the plant is healthy or diseased.
